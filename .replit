## Worker Module Fixes

Status: âœ… FIXED

* Fixed compilation errors in PingWorker, SubscriptionWorker, and UpdateWorker classes
* Properly stored WorkerParameters for correct child worker creation
* Standardized worker implementation pattern across all background task classes

## Fix Implementation

```kotlin
// Before:
class XxxWorker(
    private val context: Context,
    workerParams: WorkerParameters
) : CoroutineWorker(context, workerParams) {

// After:
class XxxWorker(
    private val context: Context,
    params: WorkerParameters
) : CoroutineWorker(context, params) {
    // Store params for later use
    private val workerParams = params
```

This fix ensures all worker classes can properly create child workers and maintains the WorkerParameters reference throughout their lifecycle.

## Remaining Tasks

* Complete Android SDK setup for full build verification
* Implement auto-ping functionality (every 10 minutes)
* Implement auto-subscription updates (every 30 minutes)
* Set up auto-connect to lowest ping server
* Implement daily routing rules updates
