What the log is really telling you

Android resource linking failed
ERROR: ...AndroidManifest.xml: AAPT: error: resource mipmap/ic_launcher         not found.
ERROR: ...AndroidManifest.xml: AAPT: error: resource mipmap/ic_launcher_round  not found.

AAPT2 stops the build because the launcher-icon files you declared in AndroidManifest.xml do not exist in app/src/main/res/mipmap-* (or in any res/drawable-* folder).

Nothing else in the trace is fatal—the “AAPT2 8.7.0” line is just the version string baked into the aapt2 binary that ships with AGP 8.6.0.
How to fix

    Check your manifest line (usually line 10):

<application
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
    … >

Those names must match real resource files.

Look inside app/src/main/res/
You should have at least one of these folders (created by Android Studio’s New ▸ Image Asset wizard):

mipmap-hdpi/
mipmap-mdpi/
mipmap-xhdpi/
mipmap-xxhdpi/
mipmap-xxxhdpi/
mipmap-anydpi-v26/

Each must contain both

ic_launcher.png
ic_launcher_round.png   (or an adaptive XML in -anydpi)

If the folders are missing or the files are named differently:

Option A – rebuild icons quickly

# In project root
mkdir -p app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi
# Copy any square PNG (e.g. 512×512) into that folder and all the other mipmap-* folders
cp /path/to/logo.png app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
cp /path/to/logo.png app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png
# Repeat for xxhdpi, xhdpi, hdpi, mdpi (or symlink if you’re just testing)

Option B – use Android Studio GUI

    Build ▸ Generate Signed Bundle/APK … → (it will prompt if icons are missing) or

    Right-click res ▸ New ▸ Image Asset, supply a foreground image, and it auto-creates every density folder plus mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml.

Re-run the build

    ./gradlew clean assembleRelease

    The processReleaseResources task should now pass.

Why did the icons disappear?

    If you started from a minimal GitHub repo, the author may have .gitignore-d the generated mipmap-* folders.

    If you renamed the application ID, Studio sometimes deletes the default icons expecting you to provide new branding.

    Unzipping on Linux with the wrong switches can drop empty directories—verify they actually contain PNG/XML files.

Once icons exist, AAPT2 links resources successfully, and the APK/AAB will be produced in app/build/outputs/….
